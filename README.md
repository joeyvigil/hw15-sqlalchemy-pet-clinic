Process Using sqlacodegen
-------------------
1. Setup virtual environment, pip installs, freeze requirements
    ```shell
    python -m venv venv
    venv\Scripts\activate

    pip install sqlalchemy
    pip install sqlacodegen

    pip freeze > requirements.txt
    ```
2. Create new file named 'model.db'
3. Create new file named 'model.sql', add CREATE statements to it, run it in 'model.db'
4. Use sqlacodegen to generate bulk of code, this is much less error prone and more consistent then writing yourself
    ```shell
    sqlacodegen sqlite:///model.db
    ```
5. Fix any errors and make it more consistant with class examples
    - add any needed imports
    - ```class Base(DeclarativeBase): ----> Base = declarative_base(); engine = create_engine('sqlite:///clinic.db')```
    - ```Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine) #Add after Classes```
    - fix anything that is causing errors (datetime and primary keys)
6. Create and manipulate data as final part of assignment



Overview
-------------------

This homework assignment will test your understanding of database relationships and SQLAlchemy ORM. You'll build a Pet Clinic Management System that demonstrates both association tables and association models.

Learning Objectives
-------------------

By completing this homework, you will:

-   Implement many-to-many relationships using either Table objects or declarative models

-   Manage database sessions and transactions effectively

-   Use modern SQLAlchemy 2.0 syntax with Mapped and mapped_column


Assignment: Pet Clinic Management System
----------------------------------------

### Part 1: Database Design

Create a simplified pet clinic management system with the following entities:

#### Core Models:

1.  Pet - Contains pet information (name, species, breed, age)
2.  Owner - Contains pet owner information (name, phone, email)
3.  Veterinarian - Contains veterinarian information (name, specialization)
4.  Appointment - Contains appointment information (date, notes, status)

#### Relationships:

-   Pets ↔ Owners: Many-to-one (multiple pets can belong to one owner)
-   Pets ↔ Veterinarians: Many-to-many (pets can see multiple vets, vets can treat multiple pets)
-   Appointments: Connect pets, veterinarians, and appointment details (Junction Table between Pet and Vet)

Set Up

```shell
-- windows --
python  -m  venv  venv
venv\Scripts\activate

-- mac --
python3  -m  venv  venv
source  venv/bin/activate

pip  install  sqlalchemy

pip  freeze  >  requirements.txt
```
### Part 2: Implementation Requirements

#### 2.1 Model Definitions

Create the following models using modern SQLAlchemy 2.0 syntax:

```python
# Required imports
from  sqlalchemy  import  create_engine,  Integer,  String,  ForeignKey,  DateTime,  Table,  Column
from  sqlalchemy.orm  import  declarative_base,  relationship,  sessionmaker,  Mapped,  mapped_column
from  datetime  import  datetime

engine = create_engine('sqlite:///clinic.db')

Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine)
session = Session() #Create Sessions

Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine) #Add to the bottom of page
```

Models to implement:

1.  Owner Model with:

    -   id (primary key)
    -   name (string, not null)
    -   phone (string, not null)
    -   email (string, unique)
    -   Relationship to pets

2.  Pet Model with:

    -   id (primary key)
    -   name (string, not null)
    -   species (string, not null) - e.g., "Dog", "Cat", "Bird"
    -   breed (string)
    -   age (integer)
    -   owner_id (foreign key to owners)
    -   Relationships to owner, veterinarians, and appointments (if you do the association model)

3.  Veterinarian Model with:

    -   id (primary key)
    -   name (string, not null)
    -   specialization (string) - e.g., "General", "Surgery", "Dermatology"
    -   email (string, unique)
    -   Relationships to pets and appointments (if you do the association model)

4.  Appointment Junction Table :\
    Either Simple Table object connecting Pet and Vet ids\
    or Association Model with the following fields

    -   id (primary key)
    -   pet_id (foreign key to pets)
    -   veterinarian_id (foreign key to veterinarians)
    -   appointment_date (datetime, not null)
    -   notes (text)
    -   status (string, default "Scheduled") - "Scheduled", "Completed", "Cancelled"
    -   Relationships to pet and veterinarian

#### 2.3 Database Setup

Create a function to:

-   Set up the database engine
-   Create all tables
-   Return a session factory

### Part 3: Database Population

Add sample data to your database using SQLAlchemy session operations. You should create your own data and add it to the database.

Requirements:

-   Add at least 3 owners with different contact information
-   Add at least 6 pets (mix of dogs, cats, birds) belonging to different owners
-   Add at least 2 veterinarians with different specializations
-   Create appointments connecting pets and veterinarians
-   Demonstrate both many-to-one and many-to-many relationships

Tips:

-   Use session.add() for individual objects or session.add_all() for multiple objects
-   Remember to call session.commit() to save your changes
-   Make sure your relationships are properly set up before adding data
